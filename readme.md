## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

On this project I started with an HTML5up template. I recreated the clients initial image of the site, and from there built out further. I put the schedualing form on each page so the client can link specific pages for each type of service. Thanks for taking a look!

## Optimizations
Plan to further build out scheduling assistant so site manager can block out days when needed. Connect with other tire vendors about possible API feed.

## Lessons Learned:

Using templates can help with productivity and provide a good starting place. However it can take some time to reveiw what is going on and fully understand the logic.

<!-- ## Examples:
